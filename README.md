## Overview
  The purpose of this project is to analyze data from CitiBike in New York City to determine if investors should start a bikesharing program in Des Moines. 
## Results
  Seven visualizations were completed to help analyze data from New York City. They are as follows:

This image shows that most rides are under a half-hour in length, and almost nonexistent over an hour.

This image shows that most riders are males, and again shows that rides are most under a half-hour in length.

This heatmap shows that most of bike usage was during the weekdays, during work commute times (6-9am & 5-8pm). It's evident that there is no usage in the early mornings and after 9pm. Also, it is important to note that Wednesday has low bike usage for the high usage times, which could be something to look into.

This image combines previous graphing resuts, showing more male bike usage along with the more usage during the commute hours.

This image shows us the usage is mostly male subscribing users, and at second most female subscribing users.

This image shows August peak hours specifically, showing us the evening is the heaviest usage. It's important to note any bike repairs are best done in the early hours, before 5am, where there is less usage. 

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100812515/173258020-8347185b-836c-4ec5-b8c0-4c907b7214bd.png)
This image shows us the age group that may bike the longest. 

## Summary
  This analysis has proven that bikeshare services are definitely popular amongst a wide range of people. Main bikeshare usage looks like it is with the male users, so marketing or outreach should be done to attract female riders. A few other visualizations I would explore would be:
  
  - gender difference visualizations to see if further analysis can be done to determine how to attract female riders
  - bike utilization to determine the needs of a bike sharingbusiness.
